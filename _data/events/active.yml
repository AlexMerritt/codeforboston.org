    BARI’s annual conference is a unique forum for greater Boston’s civic data ecosystem—spanning the public sector, private sector, non-profits, community leaders, and academia—to explore how data and technology can be used to better understand and serve our communities. “Smart cities” should be about more than just efficiency and fancy new tools; it is about partnering across institutions and communities to collaboratively transform all of our cities and towns into the places we want them to be.

    **UPDATE:** The conference will be **migrated to a virtual format** but will otherwise proceed as scheduled.
